The given program demonstrates the usage of string manipulation functions (`insert_substring`, `delete_substring`, and `replace_substring`) defined in the "strops.h" header file. Here is a brief description of what the program does:

1. Initialization:
   - The program initializes a character array `str` with the initial value "If you don’t like it, change it. If you can’t, ignore it."

2. Inserting Substrings:
   - The program uses the `insert_substring` function to insert substrings into the `str` array at specific positions.
   - It first inserts the substring "What I'd say: " at the beginning of `str` (position 0).
   - Then it inserts the substring " Make sense?" at position 100 (which is beyond the original length of `str`).
   - The modified `str` array is printed after each insertion.

3. Deleting Substrings:
   - The program uses the `delete_substring` function to delete substrings from the `str` array.
   - It attempts to delete the substrings "What ", " it", and "make" from `str` using the `delete_substring` function.
   - The return value of the function is printed along with the modified `str` array after each deletion.

4. Replacing Substrings:
   - The program uses the `replace_substring` function to replace substrings in the `str` array with new substrings.
   - It replaces the substring "change" with "don't change", " change" with an empty string, and "make" with "fake".
   - The return value of the function is printed along with the modified `str` array after each replacement.

The program demonstrates how to use the provided string manipulation functions to insert, delete, and replace substrings within a given string. It showcases the functionality of these operations by performing them on the `str` array and printing the results.
