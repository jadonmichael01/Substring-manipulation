I understand that all homework assignments for this course are individual assignments. That is, I'm expected to work on the assignment alone. That is, no code sharing or co-development is allowed. Code sharing include having another student to look at your code, looking at another student's code, copying code from another student's work via the internet, or using solutions from an early version of this course. Co-development means that a student is writing the programs together with another person. 

I testify that I have worked by myself on this assignment and I did not share code or co-develop the program with anybody.

I understand that I'm allowed to look for solutions on the internet, as long as I clearly indicate the source of the solutions in my homework assignment. For this assignment, I incorporated the following from the Internet:

[Put NONE or list the sources in the following format: 

1) In strops.c, lines 21-30, I used the solution, but modified for this assignment, from [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35631422/finding-substring-in-string-without-using-library-function]

2) In strops.c, lines 49-57, I used the solution, but modified for this assignment, from [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35631422/finding-substring-in-string-without-using-library-function]]
